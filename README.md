- 👋 Hi, I’m Poul Riis, retired high school teacher, living in Denmark.
- 👀 I’m interested in astronomy, physics and mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use different python modules to calculate time of sunset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on calculating time of sunset (defined as time when the upper rim disappears below the horizon) as accurate as possible and comparing the calculations to careful observations from a coast oriented to the west.
